# Public Science | Your Wild Life Projects

"The coolest study of biodiversity on the human body on the planet!
The belly button is one of the habitats closest to us, and yet it remains relatively unexplored. In January 2011, we launched Belly Button Biodiversity to investigate the microbes inhabiting our navels and the factors that might influence the microscopic life calling this protected, moist patch of skin home. In addition to inspiring scientific curiosity, Belly Button Biodiversity inspired conversations about the beneficial roles microbes play in our daily lives" (The Publich Science Lab, 2019).

The Link Attached above is the informative interactive dashboard that was built to reflect the data into informative iluustrated models that display all the information in the form of intuitive Visualizations!
